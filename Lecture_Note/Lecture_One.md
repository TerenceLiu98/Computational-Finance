## Three Basic Principle of Technical Analysis 

Before learning about the specific tools and techniques the technician uses to analyze various investment opportunities, it is essential that one understand the principles upon which technical analysis is based. 

The Three key principles are:
1. Eeverything is discounted and relected in market principles
2. Prices move in trends, and trends persist.
3. Market action is repetitive



## Definition of Technical Analysis

* Technical analysis si an analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices movement through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume;
* It also can be defined as simply the study of individual securities and the overall market based on supply and demand;
* Technical analysts record, usually in chart form, historical price and volume activity and deduce from that pictured histroy the probable future trend of prices;
* The beauty of technical analysis is that it can be applied effectively to virtually any trading medium and investment time horizon;
* A TA can analyze stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, commodities, and many other forms of investments for buy and sell opportunities by using the sample technical analysis tools and techniques;
* The best way to use technical analysis depends on one's approach to the market;
* it is important to apply technical analysis in a manner that complements one's own personality and individual investment philosophy

## Technical Analysis - Tools and Techniques 

Basically, technical analysis tools and techniques can be divided into TWO main categories:

* Chart/Pattern Analysis
    * Char Construction (Line, bBar, Candle stcks ...)
    * Major Chart Patterns
* Technical Analysis Tools
    * Trendlines and Channels
    * Supports and Resistances
    * Bands and Bollinger Bands
    * Technical Indicators
    * Technical Oscillators

### Charts Construction 

![Charts_Construction.png](https://i.loli.net/2020/03/05/GAHjDirBYqwNOkh.png)

#### Bar Chart

1. THe most commonly used type of price chart;
2. In a bar chart, a vertical line that ranges from the period's lowest price to ites highest price represents each time period;
3. A horizontal protrusion to the right marks the period's closing price.

#### Line (or close-only) Chart
1. Some technicians believe that the closing price is the most important price of the trading day and ,therefore, they plot only closing prices in a line chart.

#### Point and Figure Chart

1. A rising price change is represneted by an $X$ and a declining movement by an $O$. Each $X$ or $O$ occupies a box on the chart and represents a price change of a certain magnitude;
2. It is not so commonly sued now especially compared with Candlestick charts.

#### Japanese Candlestick Chart (or just "Candlestick Chart" in short)

1. Carries this name because the lines resemble candles and wicks
2. Originated by the Japanese for over 200 years
3. Now commonly used all over the world

### Major Chart Patterns

Out of the numerous chart patterns, they can be divided into THREE main categories:

1. Major Reversal Patterns (9 Types);
    * Key Reversals;
    * Head-and-Shoulders Tops/Bottoms;
    * Rounding Tops/Bottoms (saucers);
    * Ascending and Descending Triangles;
    * Rectangles(Bullish/Bearish);
    * Double and Triple Tops/Bottoms;
    * Diamond;
    * Rising and Falling wedges;
    * V-shape formations (spikes)
2. Consolidation Patterns (4 Types);
    * Flags;
    * Pennants;
    * Head-and-Shoulders Continuation Patterns;
    * Symmetrical Triangles;
3. Gaps (4 Types)
    * Common Gaps;
    * Breakway Gaps;
    * Runaway Gaps;
    * Exhaustion Gaps

## Technical Analytical Tools

1. Trendlines and Channels Analysis
2. Support and Resistance Analysis
3. Faied Chart Signals Analysis
4. Chart Analysis Using Candlestick Patterns

### Trendlines

* As mentioned, one of the principles that technical analysis is **based on the prices move in trends**. These trends can be up, down, or sideways as illustrated in;
* So shown in the figure. **An uptrend** is characterized by successively higher highs and higher lows;
* **A downtrend** occurs on successively lower highs and lower lows;
* **A sideways trend** reflects horizontal price movement;
* Trends can be **brief or of long duration**;
* They are typically classified as short, intermediate, or long term trends;

The significance of trendlines is determined by two factors:
    1. The number of points (tops or bottoms) taht the trendlines goes through
    2. The length of time the trendline has persisted without being penetrated

### Trend Channels 
* In many instances, prices repeatedly move about the same distance away from a treandline before returning to the treandline
* In this cases, a straight
