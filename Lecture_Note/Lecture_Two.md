# Chapter Three An Overview of Quantum Finance Models



* As metioned in the introductory chapter, Quantum Finance is a newly developed interdisciplinary with the integration of:
  * Quantum Theory - the provision of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory as the Quantum Finance dynamics and field analysis;
  * Computational Finance - the provision of computational finance models as the system framework and the application basis.

## Major work and R&D on Quantum Finance

Although statistical mechanics still the mainstream application of Econophysics, active R&D with the adoption of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory into fiannce can still be found.

In view of the past decades, R&D of Quantum Finance, basically there are TWO main quamtum models with significant impacts and research results in financial modelling and applications.

* There are:
  * Path Integral Approach on Quantum Finance
  * Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator Approach Finance
* In the next two sections, we will discuss the basic concept and framework of these TWO approach. 

### Path Integral Approach of Quantum Finance

* **Forward Interest Rate (aka Forward rate)** is a type of interest rate that is specified for a loan that will occur at a specified future date.
* Forward interest rates and fixed-income securities are fundamental to the finance.
* Forward rates are calculated from the spot rate and are adjuested for the cost of carry to determine the future interest rate that equates the  total return of a longer-term investment with a strategy of rolling over a shorter-term investment.
* It may also refer to the rate fixed for a future financial obligation, such as the interest rate on a loan payment. 
* B. Baaquie in his book Quantum Finance provides a systematic method on using Path Intergral Approach of QFT to model Forward Interest Rate.

#### Forward Interest Rate Model - Classical Model 

* **From the computational finance perspective**, Forward Interst Rate $f(t, x)$ is the interest rate -fixed at time $t \leq x$ - for an instantaneous (overnight) loan taken at future time $x$

* So, at any instant  $t$, $f(t, x)$ is a function of $x$ (not $t$) that can be visualized as a 1-D path in the future time domain $(x)$ satisfy $(x \geq t)$, as shown in the figure.
